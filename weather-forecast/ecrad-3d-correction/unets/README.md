# 3D Correction

## Description

Climate models are complex objects developed over decades and have many components. While the main model renders dynamics (Temperature, Wind speeds, Pressure), models of lesser magnitude substantially refine these predictions by emulating physical processes: radiation, precipitation, evaporation, clouds, ...
